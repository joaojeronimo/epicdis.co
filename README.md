# epicdis.co

All you need to start a party.

## What ?

Turn the lights off and go to [epicdis.co](http://epicdis.co)! You'll have a strobe light and a music player.

Works better in fullscreen mode (F11 on most browsers), even better if you stare at the screen from a short distance, and don't blink ;)

## Options ?

### Colors

Just put them in the address!

* [http://epicdis.co/#000/#fff](http://epicdis.co/#000/#fff) gives you that basic white and black;
* [http://epicdis.co/#FF0066/#006EFF](http://epicdis.co/#FF0066/#006EFF) gives you some kind of purple and blue;
* [http://epicdis.co/#red/green](http://epicdis.co/#red/green) gives you.. red and green.

### Bonus

* [http://epicdis.co/#random](http://epicdis.co/#random) will pick two random colors;
* [http://epicdis.co/#randomWalk](http://epicdis.co/#randomWalk) will take a walk in a rainbow.

### Music

Any numbers you put on the address will be treated as Track IDs for SoundCloud. So its easy to create your playlists:

* Flight Facilities: [http://epicdis.co/#black/orange/7823923/19736291/46230233/66170642](http://epicdis.co/#black/orange/7823923/19736291/46230233/66170642)
* Justice: [http://epicdis.co/#green/black/1831053/37928194/42162977](http://epicdis.co/#green/black/1831053/37928194/42162977)
* Deadmau5: [http://epicdis.co/#green/black/27245259/15296772/15296650](http://epicdis.co/#green/black/27245259/15296772/15296650)

## TODO

* Remove the hashes from URLs (use `history.pushState()`);
* Come up with a better algorithm for random colors, so that the difference in contrast is better;
* Implement the Search SoundCloud API (search for "Flight Facilities" instead of defining their tracks);
* Smooth cross-fade ? Probably not...
